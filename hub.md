# hub

Please setup GitHub accounts in case you haven't already. This is the ultimate "social media" for programmers. You'll literally be commiting and pushing content in the joint project from your `git` onto an online repository.

Ask as many questions as possible on the discussion forum to make sure you are never stranded.

Think of your final project as an abstract to present at this years' Stata conference in [Stanford](https://www.stata.com/meeting/us23/) to be held on 20-21 July. While the deadline for submission may have passed, I'm open to sponsoring a trip for the student voted as the #1 collaborator by the rest of the team :)
