Python has got [Jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html), R as got [Bookdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i0ElncHGRg), and Stata has got... what exactly?

Stata admitted to Jason, your outstanding TA, at last years' annual conference held in D.C. that they did not **yet** have the [full suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_suite) of collaborative tools for `reproducibility` as seen with Jupyter notebooks for Python and RStudio/Quarto for R.

Indeed, we created this [class](https://www.jhsph.edu/courses/course/37447/2022/340.700.71/advanced-stata-programming) resource for you using Jupyter-book. That is why you have to copy Stata code from the book into a .do file to get results instead of having them outputted within the document itself. As students committed to an advanced understanding of Stata, we cannot think of any better way of introducing you to advanced topics than by taking you to Stata's limits. We will have you write a Stata program, show-case the development process, and publish the results directly from Stata into an .html abstract, which we may, embarassingly, have to house on this Jupyter-book platform!

You will be the inaugural class in an annual process of pushing Stata to its limits, in an open competition with its most worthy adversaries: Python and R. Students in each successive year will have access to your projects webpage. Their goal will be to `stand on the shoulders` of the giants that preceeded them, never to reinvent the wheel, but to take it to the next level each year!
